### A Brief History of Computer Science

üåé Imagine a website that contains *all* the historical people and inventions of Computer Science, sorted chronologically or alphabetically.

***We* are going to make that site!**

## Your Task:

You have four (4) classes to create a website dedicated to your historical figure or invention. The goal is to create a site that outlines the history, complexity, and importance in Computer Science. 

### Layout:

Your site *must* include the following - but *can* include more:
- `index.html`: a home page of sorts, welcoming the reader to the page and directing them to the various sub-pages. This can include an image or two, perhaps some minor details, and links to other content.
    - `history.html`: a page dedicated to the years and dates of the invention or historical figure. When were things created, updated, or destroyed? Are there any particularly important dates?
    - `significance.html`: this is the *meat* of your research. Why is this person or thing important? What about your topic advanced technology or improved the lives of humans? 
    - `sources.html`: similar to how you were expected to give your sources on the last slide of your presentation, you must provide your sources in a bibliographical style on this page. MLA or APA formatting - that's up to you.

You might want to have more pages than these. That will be a personal decision, based on your research of the topic.

**Notes**: Don't forget to include images. You can also include *other* media or link to other sources of information. YouTube videos can either be *[embedded](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)* or linked-to. Is there a side-story or an interesting tangent you want the reader to go down? Link to it!

### Requirements:

Aside from the layout above, your site is expected to have:
- a **common look and feel**. Utilize *style* to make your pages have a common sense of theme between them. ***This does not need to be complicated or overly creative - keep it simple.***
- images stored in your actual site. Do not "hot-link" images from other locations (videos are a different story - YouTube *allows* us to embed their videos)
- no broken links or images. Test your links - make sure they go to the intended destination.
- clean code. Is your HTML or CSS a complete mess? Have you followed the proper tabbing and organization demonstrated in class? Are you using proper HTML tags and document structure?
