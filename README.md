### A Brief History of Computer Science

üåé Imagine a website that contains *all* the historical people and inventions of Computer Science, sorted chronologically or alphabetically.

***We* are going to make that site!**

## Your Task:

You have today and four (4) more classes to create a website dedicated to your historical figure or invention. The goal is to create a site that outlines the history, complexity, and importance in Computer Science. 

### Requirements:

Your site *must* include the following - but *can* include more:
- `index.html`: a home page of sorts, welcoming the reader to the page and directing them to the various sub-pages. This can include an image or two, perhaps some minor details, and links to other content.
    - `history.html`: a page dedicated to the years and dates of the invention or historical figure. When were things created, updated, or destroyed? Are there any particularly important dates?
    - `significance.html`: this is the *meat* of your research. Why is this person or thing important? What about your topic advanced technology or improved the lives of humans? 
    - `sources.html`: similar to how you were expected to give your sources on the last slide of your presentation, you must provide your sources in a bibliographical style on this page. MLA or APA formatting - that's up to you.

You might want to have more pages than these. That will be a personal decision, based on your research of the topic.

Aside from the layout above, your site is expected to have:
- a **common look and feel**. Utilize *style* to make your pages have a common sense of theme between them. ***This does not need to be complicated or overly creative - keep it simple.***
- images stored in your actual site. Do not "hot-link" images from other locations (videos are a different story - YouTube *allows* us to embed their videos)
- no broken links or images. Test your links - make sure they go to the intended destination.
- clean code. Is your HTML or CSS a complete mess? Have you followed the proper tabbing and organization demonstrated in class? Are you using proper HTML tags and document structure?

**Notes**: Don't forget to include properly named and organized images. You can also include *other* media or link to other sources of information. YouTube videos can either be *[embedded](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)* or linked-to. Is there a side-story or an interesting tangent you want the reader to go down? Link to it!

It is important to focus on *content* and overall site structure *before* you work on style. **This cannot be stressed enough**.

#### Your site **_must not_** include

- Plagiarism (_stolen_ text or content)
- Inappropriate language or images/media
- Images of classmates or people without their permission
- Private information (this is going to be a public site)
- Use of AI. We have discussed this in class.


### Rubric:
|Still Working / Next Steps| Program Requirements|Successes|
|---|---|---|
||Historical content is clear, accurate, and concise.||
| | Your site has *at least* the four pages required (see above) with the requested information / media.  | |
||Your site utilizes images and media in an engaging and meanginful way (not just randomly placed throughout).||
||All images are stored locally within your repo.||
||Files and folders are named according to the classroom standards (all lowercase, no spaces, etc)||
||File and folder *structure* follows the organization standards demonstrated in class.||
||Code is clean and easy to read or follow. Tabbing and structure of code (both HTML and CSS) follows the demonstrated standards.||
||Style or theme is consistent throughout all of the pages in the site.||
||CSS is clean and unobtrusive, not taking away from the content of the site. Furthermore, CSS is *not* the priority of the project.||
||Student has written content in their own words, not resorting to plagiarism or use of AI.||
||All sources are provided in MLA or APA format on the `sources.html` page. ||
