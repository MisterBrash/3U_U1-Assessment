# Your Task: 1.8 - Style

1. Keep in mind the update to file paths mentioned in the `README` file. You will want to keep this in mind for the upcoming unit 1 assessment!
2. Either in *this* repo, or your [1.5 - HTML Basics](https://www.brash.ca/ics3/1/5) repo, play with some of the basic style options and learn how to use selectors to apply style exactly where you want it.
